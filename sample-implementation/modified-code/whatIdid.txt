The error encountered (panic: runtime error: integer divide by zero) occurs because the xParam and yParam values in the gridConfig struct are zero, leading to division by zero when calculating imgWidth and imgHeight.

We need to set appropriate values for xParam and yParam before rendering the image grid. These values determine the number of columns and rows for the grid layout.

The error with filepath.Walk suggests a mismatch between the expected types.
- func(path string, info os.DirEntry, err error) error
+ func(path string, info os.FileInfo, err error) error
